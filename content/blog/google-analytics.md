## 🧠 GA4 vs Universal Analytics (UA)

In 2023, Google officially sunset Universal Analytics and rolled out **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**. Here’s a comparison:

| Feature                   | GA4                        | UA (Old)             |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Event-Based Tracking      | ✅ Yes                     | ❌ No                |
| Cross-Device Reporting    | ✅ Yes                     | ❌ No                |
| Predictive Metrics        | ✅ Yes (AI-powered)         | ❌ No                |
| Free BigQuery Integration | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                |
| Bounce Rate               | ⚠️ Replaced by Engagement Rate | ✅ Yes          |

**Pro Tip:** If you're still using UA, migrate to GA4 immediately to continue receiving data.
