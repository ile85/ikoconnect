## 🤖 What is Zapier?

**Zapier** is an online automation platform that connects your favorite apps and services—like Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, Notion, Shopify, Stripe, Airtable, and thousands more—so they work together **without writing a single line of code**.

With **Zapier**, you can automate repetitive tasks and build powerful workflows called **Zaps** that save you time, reduce errors, and supercharge productivity.

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- When someone fills out your **Typeform**, automatically create a row in **Google Sheets**
- When a new sale is made in **Shopify**, post a message in **Slack**
- When a new file is added to **Dropbox**, send an email via **Gmail**
- When a task is marked complete in **Trello**, notify your team via **Microsoft Teams**
- Sync contacts from **Calendly** to your **CRM**

You get the idea. It’s all about **connecting the dots** between tools you already use.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

A **Zap** has two components:

1. **Trigger** – The event that starts the workflow (e.g., “New form submission in Jotform”)
2. **Action(s)** – What happens after the trigger (e.g., “Send an email,” “Add row to sheet”)

You can even add **multiple steps**, **conditions**, and **delays** to create complex automation workflows.
