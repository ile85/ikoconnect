## 💼 What is Google Workspace?

[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) (formerly G Suite) is a **cloud-based suite of productivity tools** designed for businesses, freelancers, educators, and remote teams. It includes:

- **Google Drive** – cloud storage and file sharing
- **Docs, Sheets, Slides** – document collaboration tools
