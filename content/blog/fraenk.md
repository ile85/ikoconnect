## Why fraenk is the Ideal Mobile Provider for Freelancers 🚀

In the world of remote work and digital freelancing, staying connected isn’t just a luxury—it’s your lifeline. Whether you’re hopping between coworking spaces, jumping on Zoom calls, or working from a cozy cabin in the Alps, your mobile plan needs to *just work*.

That’s where **fraenk** comes in. Built for the modern lifestyle, fraenk is a no-BS mobile plan that cuts out the contracts, complexity, and hidden fees. Let’s break down why fraenk is lowkey one of the smartest choices for freelancers in Germany.

## What is fraenk?

## What Makes fraenk Unique?

| Feature              | fraenk            | Traditional Providers |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|

| Network              | Telekom (5G)      | Often same             |
| Contract             | None              | 24-month binding       |
| Setup Time           | Minutes (via app) | Days/weeks             |
| Cancel Anytime       | ✅                | ❌                    |

## How to Get Started in 3 Easy Steps:

1. **Download the App**  
   Get it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fraenk/id1513215324) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fraenk.app)

2. **Activate Your SIM or eSIM**  
   Choose whether you want a physical SIM or activate instantly with eSIM.

3. **Start Using It Right Away**  
   That’s it. No calls. No paperwork. You’re live within minutes.

## Real Talk: Is There a Catch? 🤔

Let’s keep it 100.

Here’s what you should know:
- The base plan only includes **Germany-wide** usage. EU roaming works, but you may need to double-check data usage limits abroad.
- No customer hotline—support is chat-based in-app (but very responsive).
- You can’t use it as a multi-SIM across tablets or watches (yet).

But if you’re a remote worker, student, or digital creator in Germany—it’s a 🔥 deal.
