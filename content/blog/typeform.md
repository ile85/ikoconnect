## 🚀 What is Typeform?

**Typeform** is a user-friendly online form builder that helps you create beautifully designed and highly interactive forms, surveys, quizzes, and more.

Unlike traditional form tools that feel cold and robotic, Typeform puts user experience front and center. Forms are presented **one question at a time**, creating a conversational flow that keeps users engaged and encourages higher completion rates.

Whether you’re collecting feedback, leads, or customer preferences—Typeform makes it feel personal.
