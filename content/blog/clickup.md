## What Makes ClickUp Stand Out?

ClickUp centralizes your entire workflow—from idea to execution. With flexible views, powerful automation, and a customizable interface, it adapts to any workflow.

Here’s what makes it special:

### ✅ Task Management

- Create tasks, assign users, set priorities and due dates  
- Add subtasks, checklists, dependencies  
- Use Custom Statuses: e.g., “Draft,” “Client Review,” “Scheduled”

### 🧠 Docs

- Collaborative editing (like Notion)  
- Embed tasks into docs  
- Ideal for wikis, SOPs, and knowledge bases

### 🎯 Goals

- Set measurable targets  
- Link goals directly to tasks  
- Visualize team OKRs and progress

### 🛠️ Custom Fields & Automations

- Add dropdowns, formulas, date pickers  
- Automate task creation, assignment, and status changes

### 💬 Real-Time Chat

- Built-in team chat  
- Create tasks from messages  
- Great for internal team collaboration

### 📊 Dashboards

- Visual overview of your work  
- Widgets for time tracking, workload, sprint progress, etc.
