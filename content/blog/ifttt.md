## 🤖 What is IFTTT?

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) stands for **“If This Then That”**. It’s a free web-based service that helps you connect different apps, services, and smart devices to automate tasks without coding.

Using simple logic (“if this happens, then do that”), you can automate workflows across platforms like:

- Gmail
- Twitter
- Google Sheets
- Smart lights (Philips Hue)
- Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant
- Slack, Notion, Trello, and many more

---

## 🔁 How IFTTT Works

Each automation is called an **Applet**. It's made up of:

- **Trigger (If This)**: Something that starts the applet.  
  *Example*: "If I receive an email from boss@company.com"

- **Action (Then That)**: What happens after the trigger.  
  *Example*: "Then send me a Slack notification."
