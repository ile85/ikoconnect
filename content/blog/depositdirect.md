What if you could move in **without paying thousands upfront**?  
That’s exactly where **DepositDirect** steps in.

## 📊 Why Freelancers and Remote Workers Love It

- Equipment or coworking memberships

## 🔍 How Safe Is DepositDirect?

DepositDirect is a **licensed financial service** operating in full compliance with German laws. Landlords accept it because it provides a **bank-grade guarantee**.

All terms are clear:

- You can cancel anytime with proper notice

They also don't ask for hidden fees, and there’s **no long-term lock-in**.

## 💸 Real Example

Let’s say your new apartment in Berlin costs **€1,000/month**.

Traditional deposit:  
3x rent = **€3,000 upfront**

With DepositDirect:  
No large payment → just **~€5.50/month** in service fee  
You move in. Your landlord gets security.  
Everybody wins.
