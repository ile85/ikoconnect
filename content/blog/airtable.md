## What is Airtable?

Airtable is a **cloud-based hybrid between a spreadsheet and a database** — designed to be as easy to use as Excel, but as powerful as a backend database. It lets freelancers, startups, agencies, and remote teams visually organize information, build custom workflows, and collaborate in real time.

From managing your content calendar and project tasks, to tracking leads or designing an automated CRM, Airtable gives you superpowers — all inside a drag-and-drop interface.

---

## Why Use Airtable?

Here’s what makes Airtable so popular (and powerful):

- ✅ **Intuitive spreadsheet interface** — looks like Google Sheets, feels like a database
- ✅ **Multiple views** — Kanban, Calendar, Gallery, Timeline, and Gantt
- ✅ **Automations** — trigger emails, Slack messages, or webhooks
- ✅ **Collaboration** — invite teammates with access controls
- ✅ **Templates** — ready-made bases for marketing, content, HR, product management, and more
- ✅ **API & integrations** — connect with Zapier, Make (Integromat), Slack, Gmail, Notion, and more
- ✅ **Mobile & desktop apps** — collaborate on the go

---

## Core Features Explained

### 🧮 Spreadsheet Meets Database

Each **Airtable Base** is like a smart spreadsheet. But each row is a "record," and each column is a "field" that can be a:

- Checkbox
- Dropdown (select)
- File upload
- Link to another table
- Formula
- Date
- Rating
- Barcode
- Button (yes, actual buttons!)

That means you’re no longer limited to boring text or numbers like in Excel.

---

### 👁️ Multiple Views for Different Use Cases

Each Base lets you view your data differently:

- **Grid View** — spreadsheet-style, perfect for editing rows quickly
- **Kanban View** — great for task management (like Trello)
- **Calendar View** — visualize due dates, content schedules
- **Gallery View** — ideal for images, portfolios, and visual assets
- **Timeline / Gantt** — manage project timelines visually

You can filter, group, sort, and color-code any view — and even share a read-only version with clients or your team.

---

### ⚙️ Airtable Automations

Automations in Airtable allow you to:

- Trigger actions when records are added/updated
- Send emails (Gmail/Outlook)
- Post to Slack
- Call webhooks (e.g., to update your own app)
- Update Airtable records
- Create Google Calendar events
- Integrate with OpenAI for AI automations (yes, really!)

No need for a separate Zapier or Make account if you stay within limits.
