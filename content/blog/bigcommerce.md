## What is BigCommerce?

**BigCommerce** is an enterprise-grade eCommerce platform built to help online sellers create, launch, and scale stores — without needing to be coding experts. From startups to high-volume brands like **Skullcandy**, **Ben & Jerry’s**, and **Sony**, BigCommerce provides the flexibility and scalability to handle it all.

Unlike simple drag-and-drop tools, BigCommerce offers full backend control, APIs, integrations, and performance features that work right out of the box.
