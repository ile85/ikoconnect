## What is Basecamp?

**Basecamp** is a simple, no-fluff project management and collaboration tool designed to help teams stay organized, aligned, and focused. Created by the folks at 37signals (now known as Basecamp), it's been a reliable tool for startups, agencies, and remote teams since 2004.

With an emphasis on calm work and asynchronous communication, Basecamp moves away from the chaos of endless Slack notifications, scattered Trello cards, or email overload. It brings everything your team needs into one place.
