## ✍️ What is Hemingway Editor?

[Hemingway Editor](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/) is a minimalist writing tool built to make your writing bold and clear. Inspired by Ernest Hemingway’s punchy style, the app highlights:

- Passive voice
- Adverbs
- Complex or long sentences
- Readability grade level
- Hard-to-read phrases

Unlike traditional grammar checkers, Hemingway is designed to improve the *style* of your writing, not just fix mistakes.
